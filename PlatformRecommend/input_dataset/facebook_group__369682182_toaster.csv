While the page is for supercars, here is the place to share anyone that makes a brain-dead comment about any form of motorsport anywhere in the world.
The only real rule in this group is be respectful!
If someone posts a screenshot of your comment you can defend yourself and explain it, if it devolves to personal attacks then people will get kicked.
When you post a screenshot, feel free to caption it. But no personal attacks. Make a joke or a reference, but don't try for what you consider your best sledge. We don't want this to turn into a group for bullying.
We'll also try post all our shots that aren't quite good enough for the main page

You've just joined one of the most radical movements of all time. You see, we're about one thing, seeing the Razer Toaster come to be comercially available in our life time. All it's going to take us is 1 Million likes on https://www.facebook.com/RazerToasterPlease We're the brains behind that page. We make the memes, share the news and spread the word. We're all about seeing our world transformed and filled with the delicious possibilities of gaming appliances, specifically the Razer Toaster. Most people don't consider just how drastically the market would change if Razer released toasters as an available product. They'd either be called crazy or copied, most likely both.
Being here you get a front row seat to the meme creation process. You get your say on what you think would be hilarious and eye catching, even the chance to contribute your own content. Feel free to ask others if you get stuck. You also get early access to stuff like Merch and other things that may pop up further down the line, including giveaways. The best part however? Is the network of friends that you'll be able to build. Please don't be afraid to engage in any and all posts.
If this doesn't sound like your thing? It doesn't matter. You're here, you're one of us and that means that you get to be a part of what we're doing. Every single person counts towards our goal, 1 person is 1 like, but that value can double, triple and multiply beyond our imagining. How you might ask? It's as simple as asking. Asking those you know, your loved ones, your friends, even your family. Pro tip, ask your mother or father. Both of Mark's parents like the page (the guy who started this). If every single person who currently likes the page convinced one more friend to like the page, and then that friend brings a friend, and their friend brings a friend and so on, we would have 1 Million likes in just under 5 days (current as of 39'900 likes). Insane right? It's up to you and to us to make it happen.
We have Discord if you want to continue the conversations that you have here whilst gaming: https://discordapp.com/invite/y7m28VT
Being here there are a few things that we need you to understand:
1. Min-Liang Tan is what some may consider to be their lord and saviour. Respect that. Regardless of what you may believe, he is undeniably one of the coolest and most influential people of our time.
2. Razer is a fantastic brand in many aspects, but please respect others who have a different preference. Razer is not the only brand out there.
3. Views, thoughts and opinions expressed in posts and content shared by members of the Razer Toaster belong solely to the poster and are not representative of the Facebook Page 'Give Us The Razer Toaster' and this Facebook Group 'Team Toaster'.
4. Respect each other with love and toasty goodness.
5. Live good, die great. Jordan Bless.10 posts a week|Private group  · 6.1K members"
